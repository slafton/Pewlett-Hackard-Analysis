# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Purpose
#### Our purpose was to find the number of retiring employees per title and to see which employees would be eligible for the mentorship program. As many employees are close to retiring this valuable data is needed to prepare for the transition. This information will also give us a good idea of how many new employees that will need to be onboarded. 

## Results 
  * From our retiring table we can see that a large number of senior engineers and senior staff are retiring.

  * The mentorship eligibility table shows that there are 1,549 employees that are eligible to be mentors. 
  * There will be eligible mentors from every department.
  * Only two managers are retiring.
        
## Summary
#### The retiring table shows that 72,458 roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact. With only 1,549 employees eligible to be mentors some onboarding of highly qualified employees may be in order. The current ratio of trainees to mentors would be 47 to 1! 

#### I broke down the available mentors per title.

From this we can cancalculate the ratios for trainees to mentors for each title.
  * Senior Staff: 60 to 1
  * Engineer: 24 to 1
  * Staff: 25 to 1
  * Senior Engineer: 90 to 1
  * Technique Leader: 47 to 1
  * Assistant Manager: 17 to 1

#### With these staggering numbers in mind I went ahead and started breaking down our data by departments and here is a sample of the analysis. The full analysis can be seen in the csv files per department. There is still a lot of analysis that can be done. How many mentors per department per title is one example that department heads may want to look into.
